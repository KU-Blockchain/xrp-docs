![what is a url and how is this specific request identified]()

We will come back here later after working on the JavaScript lecture on javascript and the web browser to get a more indepth understanding of urls, servers, and what have you 

`wss://s.altnet.rippletest.net:51233`

```javaScript
const xrpl = require('xrpl');

async function main() {
	const morgan = new xrpl.Client("wss://s.altnet.rippletest.net:51233");
	
	await morgan.connect();

		"command": "account_info",
		"account": "rPT1Sjq2YGrBMTttX4GZHjKu9dyfzbpAYe",
		"ledger_index": "validated"
	});
	
	console.log(response);
	
	morgan.disconnect();

}
main();
```
